                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                Last summer, after 8 years together, Kyle and I finally went on our very first vacation together. We were going to California for a wedding, and decided we would make our own vacation out of it. We were so excited to be going on this trip, I had no idea it was going to turn into something so special. I was completely clueless to anything happening on Kyle’s end. I guess when I look back now, he did really push to take separate suitcases...
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On our last day before we went home, we drove up into the mountains and went hiking in the Sequoia National Park, the place I was most excited to explore with Kyle that week. We had been hiking all day, and made it to our last stop, as far up in the mountains as we were going to get, and surrounded by the giant Redwood trees.  Kyle suggested we turn off the path, and walk around away from all the tourists and trails. This was nothing strange, that’s usually the direction Kyle wants to check out. I started taking pictures, and he took off looking around. He called me over a few minutes later, and said he found the perfect spot. I started looking around for why this was the “perfect spot”, and then I saw that he was down on one knee. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now I’m not sure why my first reaction was to yell at him to “stop it!”, but I thought he was teasing me, with a very believable box, and even more believable ring. I was completely stunned. After he opened the box, and popped that question, the high elevation kicked in, and I started to pass out. I’m not sure I even said yes until I was securely seated on the ground. We sat there for a while, still unsure if I should believe it, and we tried to slow down and take it all in. I asked him about every 15 minutes, the entire way down the mountain, if he was sure about what he was doing, if this was the real deal. It was going to take some time for this to sink in.

                            <p>
                                Abby has told me about her fond memories of going to California when she was younger.  Specifically, she would tell me about her trips to the redwood national forests, and how seeing the redwood trees was always so magical to her.  She always made those trips sound so fun, and I had never seen the redwoods, I promised that one day we would go out there and she would have to show me around.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Well the opportunity came knocking when a good friend of mine, who lived in California, said he was getting married and asked me to be a groomsman.  We decided to take a week after my friend’s wedding so we could see the sites she used to see when she was a kid.  One of those stops was the Sequoia National Park. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The day could not have been better.  The sky looked like a painting of a perfect summer day, sun shining brightly through a stark blue sky with the occasional white fluffy cloud lazily floating along. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We started walking around the park with a loose destination to see General Sherman, the largest tree in the world.  As we explored around, Abby was excitedly recounting her adventures of coming to this area as a child. However, I found it hard to concentrate as I knew, without a doubt, that this was the right time to ask, but I still needed the right place.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               We saw the giant sequoia, General Sherman, and then began exploring the crisscrossing paths that traversed the park at the base of the tree.  That’s when I decided we needed to get off the main path and find a special place just for us.  I stepped off the designated path, and after hiking a short way into the forest we found an outcropping of rocks that offered a little nook.  I looked around at where we were, looked at Abby, and everything felt just right.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That’s when I took a knee and asked her to marry me.  
                            </p>
